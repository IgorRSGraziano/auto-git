# ðŸ¤” What does it solve?
They are simple shell scripts to assist repetitive commands in git
# ðŸš€ How to use?
### On Windows
You must have git bash installed, just go to the repository where git was installed (usually "C:\Program Files\Git")
go into "usr/bin" and throw the file there.

### On Linux
You need to configure your $PATH to run this script

## The file runs by its name 
So you can change the names (I recommend removing the .sh)
My name recommendations are <b>acp</b> (<i>add commit push</i>) and <b>cp</b> (<i>commit and push</i>)


If the file names are these base use

```
acp "this for add all (add -A), commit, and push)"
```
or
```
cp "this for commit, and push)"
```
